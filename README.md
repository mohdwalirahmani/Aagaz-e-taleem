# Aagaz-e-taleem
Aaghaaz e Taleem AeT is a non-profit organization founded in November 2017 by students of Jamia Millia Islamia University. At AeT, we are dedicated to designing interventions aimed at reducing hunger and bridging skill gaps among children in underserved communities across Delhi. Our vision is to empower underprivileged children by providing them with access to education and opportunities for physical and mental growth. We believe in instilling morals and values that will guide them towards becoming compassionate individuals and responsible citizens of our nation. Through our efforts, we aim to equip these children with the confidence, enthusiasm, and skills necessary to make a positive impact in all aspects of society. At AeT, we live and work by the motto: EDUCATE, EMPOWER, ENLIGHTEN.
